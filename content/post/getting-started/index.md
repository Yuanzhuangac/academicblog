## Overview

WOW! The Wowchemy for Hugo is a very nice tool for me, now I can work with all my favourite tools and apps with hundreds of plugins and integrations to speed up my workflows, interact with my readers, and much more. It's also a good platform for anyone looking to take control of their data and online identity whilst having the convenience to start off with a **no-code solution (write in Markdown and customize with YAML parameters)** and having **flexibility to later add even deeper personalization with HTML and CSS**.

## What's Next?

I will try to use Rstudio and Jupyter Notebooks to directly blog on this website.

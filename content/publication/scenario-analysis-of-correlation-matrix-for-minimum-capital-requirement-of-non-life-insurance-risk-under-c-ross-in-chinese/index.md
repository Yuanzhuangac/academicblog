abstract: Non-life risks under C-ROSS are aggregated using correlation matrix,
  and scenario testing of correlation assumption is required for prudential
  supervision and capital management purposes. Due to the nature of the
  correlation matrix, the scenario testing in previous studies only provides
  minimum capital estimates under independence correlation matrix,
  comonotonicity correlation matrix and the correlation matrix respectively
  proposed by regulators, which generates very different results from actual
  situations. To address these issues, this paper uses the solvency disclosure
  data of 58 Chinese P&C insurance companies in 2022Q2 to conduct an orthogonal
  experiment with the modified nearest correlation matrix, generating the
  minimum capital requirement of each P&C insurance company under multiple
  scenarios and give range analysis and heterogeneity analysis. The results of
  this paper show that (1) The sensitivity of minimum capital may be overstated
  by using perfectly correlated and perfectly uncorrelated scenarios; (2) When
  the regulatory authorities systematically increase the elements of correlation
  matrix, capital pressure is higher for P&C insurers whose main businesses
  include automobile insurance, property insurance, marine and cargo insurance,
  liability insurance and short-term accident insurance, and whose main
  businesses are not overly concentrated; (3) The business structure of P&C
  insurers significantly affects the sensitivity of minimum capital to some
  single correlation coefficient.; (4) The nearest correlation matrix method
  does not involve discussion of eigenvalues and gives more reasonable
  sensitivity results than the traditional spectral decomposition method and (5)
  When performing the scenario analysis of correlation matrix, the orthogonal
  experiment method is less time costly compared to the stochastic simulation
  method and there are some differences in the tail characteristics of the
  empirical distribution generated by these two methods. The findings of this
  paper explain the heterogeneity of the minimum capital sensitivity of P&C
  insurers, and provide further reference for the testing of C-ROSS.
